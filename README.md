Siesta
======

Siesta is an ubiquitous, full-featured, open-source JavaScript/TypeScript testing tool, 
developed at [Bryntum](https://www.bryntum.com/) for more than 10 years.

Version 6 is a complete rewrite, using a modern technology stack and the decade of test driven development experience.

Main features:

- Running tests in multiple environments: browsers, Node.js and Deno, assuming that the code being tested is isomorphic
- Supports parallel execution
- Provides accurate and well-formatted deep diff for equality assertion

Siesta powers the test suites of all [Bryntum products](https://www.bryntum.com) and thousands of our clients.
